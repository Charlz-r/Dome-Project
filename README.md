# Dome Projection Graphics in TouchDesigner  

## Overview  
This project builds on a pre-existing dome projection setup in TouchDesigner, where I designed three unique visuals to be projected onto the dome. Each visual explores different motion and texture techniques to create immersive effects.  

## Graphics Design  

### 1. **Fabric Warp (Pixel Relocators + Noise Mesh)**  
- Uses pixel relocators combined with a noise mesh.  
- Produces a fabric-like warping effect.  
- Features rainbow colors flowing dynamically across the surface.  

### 2. **Powder Waterfall (FeedbackEdge + Dripping Effect)**  
- Uses FeedbackEdge to generate a cascading effect.  
- Appears as a colorful waterfall, but with a powdery texture instead of liquid.  
- Flows down the sides of the dome, creating an organic, evolving motion.  

### 3. **Warped Portrait (2-Stage Warping + Motion Patterns)**  
- Uses a two-stage warping technique to distort a portrait.  
- Creates stretching and twisting movements.  
- The motion follows a fluid yet structured pattern, adding a surreal effect.  

## Notes  
- All visuals are optimized for dome projection, ensuring proper distortion correction.  
- The project leverages TouchDesignerâ€™s real-time rendering capabilities to create dynamic, evolving visuals.
